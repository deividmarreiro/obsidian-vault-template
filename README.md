# Description

Well this vault was made as a bases for taking notes using the method of Zettelkasten to have like a Second Brain, like a knowledge dimension, so if you have a terrible memory like me, this can help you.

And I'm also using the PARA method from Tiago Forte, _you can find the reference in the end_, and this method we'll use to set goals, measurable and quantifiable to reach an outcome.
