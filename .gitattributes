# Auto detect text files and perform line ending normalization
# This configuration applies to all files in the repository
# Explanation:
# The wildcard (*) ensures that this rule applies to all files in the repository.
# The 'text=auto' setting tells Git to automatically detect text files and perform line ending normalization.
# When a file is detected as a text file:
# - Git will store the file in the repository with LF (Line Feed) line endings, ensuring consistency across all platforms.
# - When checking out the file on a Windows system, Git will convert LF to CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) to match the native Windows line ending format.
# - When checking out the file on a Unix/Linux/Mac system, Git will retain the LF line endings.
# This helps prevent issues related to inconsistent line endings across different operating systems,
# avoiding unnecessary diffs and merge conflicts caused by line ending differences.
